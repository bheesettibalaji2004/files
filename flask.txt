---------------FORMS :-------------
GET :- data is visible in url after sending data
POST :- data is hidden in url after sending data
* in html at form if you add action="name" then you have to create a new route("/name") and write a function to see data .

^ if method is get then no errors are found ^
^ if method is POST then it displays error (to solve this we have to check condition is get or post) ^

 

render_template:
	-->render_template("sample.html")
	it is used to display html pages
redirect: 
	-->redirect("/")
	In forms to check form is get or post then use it in 2nd url(route) if it is used in main url it cause error ^by default forms always in get method so else (get)condition became true and it occurs continuously and display error 	(this page isn't working)
url_for:
	-->redirect(url_for("function name"))
	In forms at 2nd url(condition checking url) instead of writing redirect ,add url_for also (incase path change then output of redirect also change to ensure that add FunctionName which is fixed)
flash:
	--> (in condition if username already exist)
