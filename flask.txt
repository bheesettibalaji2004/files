redirect: 
	-->redirect("/")
	In forms to check condition if it is get or post then use it in another url(not in same main url that return html file)
url_for:
	-->redirect(url_for("function name"))
	In forms for 2nd url(condition checking url) instead of writing redirect add url_for also (incase path change then answer of redirect also change to ensure that add FunctionName which is fixed)
